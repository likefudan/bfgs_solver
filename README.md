# bfgs_solver

## Synopsis

Provide generic L-BFGS solver for nolinear convex optimization 

## Code Example

## Motivation

In Positron emission tomography, the variations in the efficiency of scintillation crystals must be accounted for during the image reconstruction process. Each detection pair (LOR: line-of-response) is then corrected by a positive scaling variable. Due to the nature of the huge dimension of the LOR space, this correction vector is estimated using a decomposed method, which is called component based normalization.

Correction vector is find by maximizing the log likelihood equation *y=poisson(Hx)* where the unkonw variable are within *H*. fdas By
